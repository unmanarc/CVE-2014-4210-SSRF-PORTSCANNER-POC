## Functionality

This program is a proof of concept of CVE-2014-4210 bug present in WebLogic. 

It takes advantage of the SSRF bug to check if some port is open or closed, 
It can be used to port scan remote ports.

## How it works

uddi explorer uses JS to display the web, so it was not easy to make a console-based JS interpreter to decode the information (like a curl with bash). 

therefore, I opted to use a embedded web browser to execute the request with the SSRF vulnerability. This runs in a loop and gets remote open ports.

## How to build

first download/clone this repo and cd into it, then:

```
qmake-qt5 .
make
```

You may also use qtcreator to build, just open the .pro project file with it and run.
